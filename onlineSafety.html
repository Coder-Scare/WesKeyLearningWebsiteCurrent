                        <br>
                       <h3 class="bigger1">Policy and Procedures</h3>
                       <h4>Introduction</h4>
                       <p>Wes Key Learning (WKL) aims to provide the highest level of safeguarding during online lessons.
                           The information below outlines how we aim to do this.
                           These policies and procedures aim to ensure that all persons using WKL can do so safely within child safeguarding standards and UK Law. These policies should be read in conjunction with the WKL terms and conditions.
                           </p>
                           <br>
                       
                       <h3>Aims:</h3>    
                       <ul>
                           <li>To safeguard all students and other individuals using the WKL website and online lessons.</li>
                           <li>This policy contains the responsibilities of all persons using WKL, including tutors, students and parents.</li>
                           <li>It is necessary that all individuals using or working on behalf of WKL are aware of this policy and have a full understanding of the safeguarding procedures.</li> 
                       </ul>
                           <p>This policy should be read and understood before commencing with any activity arranged through WKL. Thereby, these policies and procedures are therein adhered to. Contravention of the policy document could lead to suspension and/or barring from services.</p>
                        <br>
                           <h3>General Information:</h3>
                           <ul> <li>WKL tutors all hold a current and active Enhanced DBS certificate. All tutors who wish to join WKL will require a current and active DBS/CRB certificate, otherwise they will not be permitted to register and conduct online tuition.</li>
                               <li>DBS certificates will be displayed on the website against each tutor’s information. This information will also be readily available upon request.</li> <br>
                               <p class="below"> All communication with our tutors will go through the proper and secure channels that have been provided on our website. This information can also be found on our social media pages which are again, linked to our website.</p>
                               <p>WKL encourages students and parents to provide feedback on our review section of the website. This helps us to improve our services and provide prospective students and parents/responsible adults the best possible experience.</p>
                           </ul>
                               <br>

                               <h3>Privacy</h3>
                               <p>All communications between tutors, parents and students will be conducted via the provided forms of contact. All personal details about the student and parents, including contact address and phone number, will remain private and confidential.
                                   <br><br>
                                   All data held by WKL is in accordance with the <a class="dataProtection" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents" target="_blank">Data Protection Act 1998</a>.
                                   </p>
                                   <br>
                               <h3>Recording Of Sessions</h3>
                               <p>Occasionally some lessons will be recorded with the consent of a parent/responsible adult. These videos/clips will be published on the website and possibly on our social media channels. Group recordings are not included. The recordings remain the property of WKL.
                                   <br><br>
                                   WKL will allow access to UK law enforcement of any recording where it is reported a criminal offense may have occurred in relation to a specific session.

                                       <li>Treat students fairly and without prejudice or discrimination; students who have a disability or come from a minority ethnic or cultural group can easily become victims of discrimination and prejudice which may be harmful to the student’s well-being.</li>

                                       <li>Not make any improper suggestions to a student.</li>
                                       <li>Not send unsolicited communications to the student or parent/responsible adult.</li>
                                       <li>Value and take students’ contributions seriously and ensure that students value and respect each other’s contributions.</li>
